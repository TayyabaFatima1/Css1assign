    <h1>i saw the sign</h1>
    <p>and it opened up my eyes. One of my favorite things to do is to capturethe american nostalgia of signage. They tell us <br>where we're going or where we've been. They express a mood or saying can even just be a shape. But it's the vintage, <br>neon, and big light bulbed signs that say so much more. They aren't just your average square shapes with letters on it <br> Some actual thought and planning wentinto the making of the sign. Oh and the lost are of advertising with nneon signs <br>that display motion is always a fun find! Such a lost art in my opinion.LED just hurts my eyes...doesn't it</p>
